Vert is a weird mix between a tablet and a monitor. Its small enough to be used as a tablet, but big enough to be used as a monitor! This is my first open hardware project, so it may end up poorly. I really want to make this for myself and when comes the time when i feel like its solid and done, ill release it to the internet. </p>
